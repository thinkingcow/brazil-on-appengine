import java.io.IOException;

/**
 * The interface for writing HTTP handlers.  Provides basic functionality
 * to accept HTTP requests and dispatch to methods that handle the request.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #init(Server, String)} method is called before this
 * <code>Handler</code> processes the first HTTP request, to allow it to
 * prepare itself, such as by allocating any resources needed for the
 * lifetime of the <code>server</code>.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #respond(Request)} method is called to handle an HTTP request.
 * This method, and all methods it calls must be thread-safe since they may
 * handle HTTP requests from multiple sockets concurrently.  However, each
 * concurrent request gets its own individual {@link Request} object.
 * <p>
 * Any instance variables should be initialized in the
 * {@link #init(Server, String)}, and only referenced, but not set in the
 * {@link #respond(Request)} method.  If any state needs to be retained, 
 * it should be done either by associating it with the {@link Request}
 * object, or using the
 * {@link sunlabs.brazil.session.SessionManager session manager}.
 * Class statics should be avoided, as it is possible, and even common to
 * run multiple unrelated Brazil servers in the same JVM.  As above, the
 * {@link sunlabs.brazil.session.SessionManager session manager}
 * should be used instead.
