/**
 * Template to lock a resource.
 * &lt;lock name=xxx&gt; ... &lt;/lock&gt;
 * Claim exclusive access to the lock named "xxx".
 * Locks are used to serialize access to sections of markup, thus
 * insuring the integrity of data structures.  Traditionally, this was
 * done by managing sessions: since only one template may be active per
 * session, forcing all access to serialized regions into the same session
 * has the desired effect.  However, since sessions are typically managed on
 * a per URL basis, each serialized piece of markup needs to be in its own
 * URL, and a pair of SimpleSessionHandler/UrlMapperHandler needs to be
 * configured for each named serialized region.
 * <p>
 * Only one lock may be held at a time. The current lock (if any) is
 * automatically released at the end of the template.  Care should
 * be taken not to acquire a lock then invoke a blocking operation
 * (such as with the QueueTemplate) or deadlock may occur.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;lock name="server"&gt;
 *   &lt;set namespace="server" name=.....&gt;
 *   ...
 *   &lt;set namespace="server" name=.....&gt;
 * &lt;/lock&gt;
 * </pre>
 * This insures that no other session may access the code protected
 * by the "server" lock, either from this or any other template.
