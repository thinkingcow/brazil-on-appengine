 *   re: Tags with special body syntax (like <script> or <style>)
 *   -- Given "<script></script>" (with nothing between the "<script>"
 *   and the "</script>"), parser was not seeing "</script>" and
 *   it was grabbing the entire rest of the document as the body of
 *   the script tag.
 *   -- Singleton "<script src=foo />" will now also work.

/**
 * This class breaks up HTML into tokens.
 * <p>
 * <a name=intro></a>
 * This class differs slightly from LexML as follows: after certain tags,
 * like the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, the body that follows is
 * uninterpreted data and ends only at the next, in this case,
 * <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tag, not at the just the next
 * "&lt;" or "&gt;" character.  This is one way that HTML is not fully
 * compliant with XML.
 * <p>
 * The default set of tags that have this special processing is
 * <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>, and
 * <code>&lt;xmp&gt;</code>.  The user can change this by retrieving
 * the Vector of special tags via
 * <code>getClosingTags</code>, and modifying it as needed.
