package sunlabs.brazil.template;

/**
 * Parent for all classes that are templates.  This class is used
 * primarily as a sanity check, to make sure only classes that intend to
 * be used as templates actually are.  Subclasses are expected to implement
 * methods whose names corrospond to html/XML tags that are discovered
 * and called via introspection.
 * <p>
 * In the future, various "dummy" subclasses  may be used as alternate parents
 * to indicate which session behavior is expected.
 * <p>
 * In the current implementation, access to each instance
 * is restricted to one thread at a time.
 * In many situations this is a good compromise
 * between ease of coding templates and server performance.
 * As a new instance is created for
 * each session, multiple threads may be active at once, although only one
 * per session.
 * <p>
 * In the future, it is expected that an alternative mode of running
 * templates will be available that
 * will remove the current synchonization lock around each template
 * instance, allowing multiple threads to access each instance at once.
 * <p>
 * To take advantage of this new scheme
 * templates should be written
 * <i>thread safe</i>.  They should avoid using instance variables
 * if possible.  If state needs to be passed among methods, it may
 * be stored in the <code>RewriteContext</code>, as each thread has its own.
 * <p>
 * Configuration properties:
 * <dl class=props>
 * <dt> <code>debug</code>
 * <dd> If this configuration parameter is true, sub-classes that
 *	call the <i>debug</i> method will have diagnostic information
 *	added to the html output as comments.  If no <code>debug</code>
 *      property is associated with the template prefix, the value of
 *      <code>debug</code> with the prefix for the class registering this
 *      template is used instead.
 * </dl>
