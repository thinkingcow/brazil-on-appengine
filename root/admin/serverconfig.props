# Dynamic host properties
# hosts that match any of the sub=server patterns are dispatched
# to that server, with its own variant of the server properties
# specified in the "config" property.  Each subserver may have it's own
# properties file, or they can share one (using the handler as the
# distinguishing entry point.  For servers that use the same server
# configuration, but different data to drive the template, the per server
# config files can be used to determine which dataset to use.
#
# If a host doesn't match a pattern, this handler is skipped, and the
# base configuration is used.
#
# To change any of the configurations while the server is running, upload
# the changed (or new) versions of the config files to the virtual file
# system (presumably using the non-matching-host portion of the configuration)
# and clear the server property:
#    [prefix].initialized
# Which will cause the new configuration to take effect for all new requests.
