This is the root of the virtual filesystem for the server.
Once the server is started, upload this directory to the server
to create the "web site".

To change a file, change it here, and re-upload it.
Since the server configuration may be uploaded and changed on the fly,
the entire personality of the server can be changed dynamically: the need
to redeploy the server is only required if you need to modify the code.

This "filesystem" is a skeleton version of the one used internally for
"demo" purposes that works in conjunction with the supplied sample config
file.  It will likely need to be modified to suit your needs.
